# Bald_eye-color_child-detector
A CNN model that is trained on two different datasets for Baldness detection and Child detection detects whether the new image supplied is a child or not is bald or not and what is the eye color.

## For Baldness Detection
The CNN model was build using a seperate dataset of bald and Not Bald people images. That model was used to predict the results of the new images.

## For Child Detection
The CNN was trained on a seperate dataset of child and adult images. That model was used to predict the results of the new images.

## Eye Color Detection
Eye Color detection was done using the Haar_eye_cascade model , which detects the location of eyes on the images then finding out the dominant color to get the 
eye color of the image.

## GUI
The gui was built using Tkinter, Just run the gui.py file and upload and image to get results.
